# vegetables-rating-database
Create a vegetables rating database with mongoose. 

## Set-Up:
On the Command Line Interface (CLI) cd into your project and do the following:

1) Initialize npm. Follow the prompts on the CLI. This will create a package.json file.
```
npm init
```

2) Install Mongoose using npm. See documentation here: [Click Me](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) 
```
npm install mongoose
```

When you install Mongoose this will do the following:
* Downloads the Mongoose package and the dependencies it requires
* Saves the package in the node_modules directory
* Records the dependency information in the package.json file
